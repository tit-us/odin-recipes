# odin-recipes

My goal for this project is to make a webpage that will consist of a main index page which will have links to 3 of my favorite recipes.

I will create an initial index.html page and then a few recipe files to have hyperlinked on the index.html landing page. The 3 recipe files will contain embedded images on the page and also lists for the ingredients and also the instructions.

I will us my terminal and commit my project at multiple points throughout the process, using the proper commit etiquette I learned yesterday.

At the end of the creating process I will publish my webpage on the internet through github, to share with my girlfriend and my family.
